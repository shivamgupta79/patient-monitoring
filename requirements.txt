# Arduino Libraries
MAX30100_PulseOximeter@1.2.0          # For heart rate and SpO2 sensor (MAX30100)
OneWire@2.3.6                          # Required for DS18B20 temperature sensor
DallasTemperature@3.9.0               # For working with DS18B20 sensor
NimBLE-Arduino@1.4.1                  # For BLE scanning and RSSI (by h2zero)

# ESP32 Board Core (via Board Manager URL)
esp32@2.0.11                           # ESP32 core by Espressif Systems

🔧 ESP32 Board Manager URL
Add this to File > Preferences > Additional Board URLs in Arduino IDE: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
Then install:
Board: ESP32 by Espressif Systems
Version: 2.0.11 (or higher)

📝 How to Use
There is no native pip install -r requirements.txt for Arduino. Instead:
Open Arduino IDE
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
Search and install the listed libraries one by one (with correct versions)

arduino-cli lib install "MAX30100_PulseOximeter@1.2.0"
arduino-cli lib install "OneWire@2.3.6"
arduino-cli lib install "DallasTemperature@3.9.0"
arduino-cli lib install "NimBLE-Arduino@1.4.1"
